        <h1 class="display-3 mb-4">Livecoding</h1>
        <p>
          I started engaging myself with coding for audio and with livecoding in
          2020 when COVID-19 hit by getting into
          <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider"
            >SuperCollider</a
          >
          and related things. I'm not super experienced really and my approach
          to it is rather experimental. But still, I love to learn and to share
          my skills and ideas and get in touch with people who are interested in
          livecoding, algorithmic music, open-source music tools etc. So,
          <em>hit me up</em>, if you're interested to <em>collaborate</em> or
          <em>chat</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't done a lot of livecoding performances myself yet, but here's
          some snippets:

        <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">Workshop</h2>
        <p>
          I also started to offer
          <em
            >workshops on livecoding and music production with free software
            tools</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is very common still among music producers, beat makers and
          so on to use corporate and oftentimes expensive software to make music
          at home on the computer (or in the studio), there's also a plethora of
          free and open-source software tools that allow users to do music with
          a minimal (or zero) budget and get results that are just as exciting
          and inspiring as what you'd get by using popular applications like
          Ableton Live, Serum etc. One of the great things about engaging one
          with these open-source tools is that you will quickly be introduced to
          a vast <em>community</em> of people that work on and with these
          applications and are ready to share their knowledge and expand the
          possibilities of these apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my workshops, I present some of these software tools and share
          ideas on how to work and perform with
          <em>free music-making software</em>. The workshop is mostly for
          beginners, but even those that are already familiar with making music
          on the computer will probably get some new insights into the world of
          open-source music apps and learn about new and exciting tools like
          <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">ORCΛ</a>,
          <a href="http://tidalcycles.org">TidalCycles</a>,
          <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a> and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the course of the workshop, I will give an introduction on how
          to <em>record and arrange</em> musical ideas with these software tools
          and people will learn how to <em>algorithmically</em> generate MIDI
          notes and sequences, be introduced to ways of creating and
          <em>designing sounds</em> and hear about livecoding as one approach to
          presenting your musical ideas on stage or in a live stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I'm <em>relying a lot on open-source tools</em> and the
          communities around it, I don't do these workshops commercially and am
          happy to avoid money. ;)
