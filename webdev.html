    <h1>Web dev</h1>
    <p>
      As a web developer I like to collaborate with people that are into
      creative uses web technology and that like unconventional designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for frameworks, I usually stick to <em>SvelteKit</em> and <em>Next.js</em> (or <em>React</em>
      respectively), though I'm always curious to discover new stuff. Other than
      that, I also like using <em>JAMStack</em> and <em>Static Site Generators</em> for certain
      projects. And sometimes plain old <em>PHP</em> development also has its place in my toolbox.
