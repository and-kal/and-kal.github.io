    <h1>Livecoding</h1>
    <p>
      As Staxl I'm engaging myself with live coding languages and tools for audio and video. My entry point for this was
      always
      <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperCollider</a>
      and <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TidalCycles</a>. However, there's
      quite a bit of logic you can do in <a href="https://www.ableton.com" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Ableton</a> and with <a href="https://maxforlive.com/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Max4Live</a>, too. So I'm
      also using that for algorithmic live stuff. Furthermore, I'm utilizing a <a href="https://norns.community/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monome norns</a> in live situations sometimes.
      My approach is rather experimental and basically
      inspired by the tools I use and by the ideas that float around in the
      SuperCollider/TidalCycles and the monome community - and also by breakcore music quite a bit.

      I haven't done a hell lot of livecoding performances myself yet, but here's
      some snippets:

    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">TOPLAP Leipzig</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://toplap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPLAP</a> stands for <em>T</em>emporal
      <em>O</em>rganisation for the <em>P</em>ragmatics of <em>L</em>ive
      <em>A</em>rtistic <em>P</em>rogramming and is an interntional network of
      coders, artists, organizers and all kinds of people that are into creative
      and artistic approaches to programing, hacking and coding. (You can read all
      about in the <a href="https://toplap.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPLAP
        Wiki</a>.)
      Despite being a decentralized group, they got nodes (i.e. local
      organizations) in various cities around the globe. However, Leipzig, where
      I'm based, is missing on the map, which is why I'm trying to get TOPLAP
      Leipzig going in the near future. I love to get in touch with people who are
      interested in livecoding, algorithmic music, open-source music tools etc.
      and to share skills and ideas. If you're interested in an exchange, or if
      you want to participate, hit me up!
    </p>
    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">Practice</h2>
    <p>
      My musical practice is a lot about
      <em>livecoding and music production with open-source software tools</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is very common still among music producers, beat makers and so on
      to use corporate and oftentimes expensive software to make music at home on
      the computer (or in the studio), there's also a plethora of open-source software tools that allow users to do
      music with a minimal (or
      zero) budget and get results that are just as exciting and inspiring as what
      you'd get by using popular applications. One of
      the great things about engaging one with these open-source tools is that you
      will quickly be introduced to a vast <em>community</em> of people that work
      on and with these applications and are ready to share their knowledge and
      expand the possibilities of these apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some tools I really dig are
      <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCÎ›</a>,
      <a href="https://ppooll.klingt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ppooll</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardinal</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use these tools in order to
      <em>record and arrange</em>
      musical ideas with and <em>algorithmically</em>
      generate MIDI notes and sequences, create and
      <em>design sounds</em> and present musical ideas on stage (or in a stream).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I'm <em>relying a lot on open-source tools</em> and the communities
      around it, I don't try to get commercial with this. ;)
