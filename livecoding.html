    <h1>Livecoding</h1>
    <p>
      I started engaging myself with coding languages for audio and video, and
      with livecoding languages in particular in 2020 when COVID-19 hit by getting
      into
      <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider">SuperCollider</a>
      and related things. My approach is rather experimental and basically
      inspired by the tools I use and by all the ideas that float around in the
      livecoding community - and also by breakcore music a bit, hehe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't done a hell lot of livecoding performances myself yet, but here's
      some recent snippets:

    <p>
      <a href="http://toplap.org/">TOPLAP</a> stands for <em>T</em>emporal
      <em>O</em>rganisation for the <em>P</em>ragmatics of <em>L</em>ive
      <em>A</em>rtistic <em>P</em>rogramming and is an interntional network of
      coders, artists, organizers and all kinds of people that are into creative
      and artistic approaches to programing, hacking and coding. (You can read all
      about in the <a href="https://toplap.org/wiki/Main_Page">TOPLAP Wiki</a>.)
      Despite being a decentralized group, they got nodes (i.e. local
      organizations) in various cities around the globe. However, Leipzig, where
      I'm based, is missing on the map, which is why I'm trying to get TOPLAP
      Leipzig going in the near future. I love to get in touch with people who are
      interested in livecoding, algorithmic music, open-source music tools etc.
      and to share skills and ideas. If you're interested in an exchange, or if
      you want to participate, hit me up!
    </p>

    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">Workshop</h2>
    <p>
      I also started to offer
      <em>workshops on livecoding and music production with free software tools</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it is very common still among music producers, beat makers and so on
      to use corporate and oftentimes expensive software to make music at home on
      the computer (or in the studio), there's also a plethora of free and
      open-source software tools that allow users to do music with a minimal (or
      zero) budget and get results that are just as exciting and inspiring as what
      you'd get by using popular applications like Ableton Live, Serum etc. One of
      the great things about engaging one with these open-source tools is that you
      will quickly be introduced to a vast <em>community</em> of people that work
      on and with these applications and are ready to share their knowledge and
      expand the possibilities of these apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my workshops, I present some of these software tools and share ideas on
      how to work and perform with
      <em>free music-making software</em>. The workshop is mostly for beginners,
      but even those that are already familiar with making music on the computer
      will probably get some new insights into the world of open-source music apps
      and learn about new and exciting tools like
      <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">ORCÎ›</a>,
      <a href="http://tidalcycles.org">TidalCycles</a>,
      <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a> and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the course of the workshop, I will give an introduction on how to
      <em>record and arrange</em>
      musical ideas with these software tools and people will learn how to
      <em>algorithmically</em>
      generate MIDI notes and sequences, be introduced to ways of creating and
      <em>designing sounds</em> and hear about livecoding as one approach to
      presenting your musical ideas on stage or in a live stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I'm <em>relying a lot on open-source tools</em> and the communities
      around it, I don't do these workshops commercially. ;)
