    <h1>Algorave / Livecoding</h1>
    <p>
      As Staxl I'm engaging myself with live coding languages and software tools for generating audio and video. My
      entry points for this are usually
      <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperCollider</a>
      and <a href="https://tidalcycles.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TidalCycles</a>. However, there's
      quite a bit of logic you can do in <a href="https://www.ableton.com" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Ableton</a> and with <a href="https://maxforlive.com/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Max4Live</a>, too. So I'm
      also exploring these things for algorithmic live stuff. I'm also utilizing a <a href="https://norns.community/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monome norns</a> in live situations sometimes.
      My approach is rather experimental and basically
      inspired by the tools I use and by the ideas that float around in the
      <a href="https://algorave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algorave</a> community - and also by
      sound art, breakcore and jungle music quite a bit.

      I haven't done a hell lot of livecoding performances myself yet, but here's
      some snippets:

    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">LOL2</h2>
    <p>
      LOL2 stands for <em>League of Livecoding Leipzig</em> and is a network of people interested in creative coding. <a
        href="https://solsarratea.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sol Sarratea</a> and I started LOL2
      in the Summer 2023 in order to create a space for people to explore livecoding languages, algorithmic composition
      etc. You can think of it as an unofficial node of <a href="http://toplap.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPLAP</a> (<em>T</em>emporal
      <em>O</em>rganisation for the <em>P</em>ragmatics of <em>L</em>ive
      <em>A</em>rtistic <em>P</em>rogramming) – an interntional network of
      coders, artists, organizers and all kinds of people that are into creative
      and artistic approaches to programing, hacking and coding; cf. the <a href="https://toplap.org/wiki/Main_Page"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPLAP Wiki</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to get involved with <em>LOL2</em>, you can simply join <a href="https://discord.gg/CPs6KcMBk6"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Discord Server</a>, where most of the communication takes place.
      You can send me an email, too, though (– we've got a newsletter list)
    </p>
    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">Practice</h2>
    <p>
      My musical practice is a lot about
      <em>livecoding and music production with open-source software tools</em> and a little bit of open-source hardware
      (#OSHW) as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of
      the great things about engaging yourself with these open-source tools is that you
      will quickly be introduced to a vast <em>community</em> of people that work
      on and with these applications and are ready to share their knowledge and
      expand the possibilities of these apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some tools I really dig are
      <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCΛ</a>,
      <a href="https://ppooll.klingt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ppooll</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardinal</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use these tools in order to
      <em>record and arrange</em>
      musical ideas with, and to <em>algorithmically</em>
      generate MIDI notes and sequences, create and
      <em>design sounds</em> and present musical ideas on stage (or in a stream).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I'm <em>relying a lot on open-source tools</em> and the communities
      around it, I don't try to get commercial with this. ;)
    </p>

      Hit me up, if you like to collaborate!
