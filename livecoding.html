    <h1>Algorave / Livecoding</h1>
    <p>
      As Staxl I'm engaging myself with live coding languages and software tools
      for generating audio and video. My entry points for this are usually

      I haven't done a hell lot of livecoding performances myself yet, but
      here's some snippets:

      LOL2 stands for <em>League of Livecoding Leipzig</em> and is a network of
      people interested in creative coding.

      and I started LOL2 in the Summer 2023 in order to create a space for
      people to explore livecoding languages, algorithmic composition etc. You
      can think of it as an unofficial node of

    <h2 class="display-3 mt-3">Practice</h2>
    <p>
      My musical practice is a lot about
      <em>livecoding and music production with open-source software tools</em>
      and a little bit of open-source hardware (#OSHW) as well. However, at the
      moment I'm using some proprietary tools as well: Since there's quite a bit
      of logic and conditional stuff you can do in
      <a
        href="https://www.ableton.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Ableton</a
      >
      and with
      <a
        href="https://maxforlive.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Max4Live</a
      >
      tools, I'm also exploring these things for algorithmic live stuff and
      usually use livecoding languages and DAWs together. I'm also utilizing a
      <a
        href="https://norns.community/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >monome norns</a
      >
      in live situations or for sparking some ideas sometimes. My approach is
      rather experimental and basically inspired by the tools themselves that I
      use and by the ideas that float around in the
      <a href="https://algorave.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Algorave</a
      >
      community – well, and also by sound art, breakcore and jungle music quite
      a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the great things about engaging yourself with open-source tools and
      being part of the livecoding community is that you will quickly be
      introduced to a vast <em>community</em> of people that work on and with an
      ensemble of exciting applications and to people that are happy to share
      their knowledge as well as to expand the possibilities of the tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some tools I really dig are
      <a

        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"

      >,
      <a

        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >ppooll</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"

      >
      and
      <a href="https://vital.audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Vital</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use these tools in order to
      <em>record and arrange</em>
      musical ideas with, and to <em>algorithmically</em>
      generate MIDI notes and sequences, create and
      <em>design sounds</em> and present musical ideas on stage (or in a
      stream). Since I'm <em>relying a lot on open-source tools</em> and the
      communities around it, I don't try to get commercial with this by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're wondering about the sounds I use in my music and my sound design
      approaches, I recommend these artists' tutorials and track breakdowns,
      which I found really inspiring:
